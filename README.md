# Summary

Implement a Perceptron, train it to classify documents as HAM and SPAM.

The program prints the accuracy of the perceptron at each iteration of training. The number of iterations has been hard coded.

During the testing phase, the output class and the filename is printed.

Finally we print the accuracy of the perceptron in the testing phase.

# Program Execution

1. command line arguments must be as follows
	python Perceptron2.py path-to-trainclass1-data path-to-trainclass2-data  test  path-to-testclass1-data path-to-testclass2-data

#Performance

Pretty good, got an accuracy of 91.42259414225941 using
340 ham files
123 spam files
for training
and 
348 ham files
130 spam files
for testing
